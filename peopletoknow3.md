# People to Know 3

## Konrad Zuse
German | Engineer, inventor & computer pioneer. B: 1910 - D: 1995. The worlds first programable computer, the program-controlled Turing-complete Z3, became operational in May 1941. Regarded as the inventor of the modern computer. Founded one of the first computer buisnesses in 1941, that produced the Z4, which was the worlds first commercial computer. 1943 to 1945 he produced the first high-level programming language Plankalkül. Was given resources by the Nazi German Government, which led to much of his work being ignored by the UK and US.

## Grace Hopper
American. B: 1906 - D: 1992. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. She encouraged the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the developement of the first high-level programming languages, COBOL. he U.S.  Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her. posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.

## RALPH H. BAER
German American. B: 1922 – D: 2014. Known as the "Father of Video Games". Born in Germany, but fled to the US before ww2. Proposed the idea of playing video games on televisions, but had his idea get shot down. Later revisited his idea later on and created 8 different prototypes, the last two becoming Magnavox Odyssey. Helped develop other consoles and consumer game units. Was awarded the National Medal of Technology for his work with interactive video games.

## ALAN TURING & DAVAID CHAMPERNOWNE
English | English. B: 1922 – D: 2014 | B: 1912 – D: 2000. Created one of the first chess-playing computer programs. Champernowne worked in statistical section of the prime minister's office during WW2 to supply quantitative info to Churchill. Was later a Proffesor of Economics and Statistics at Oxford/Cambridge.  "Since there was no machine yet that could execute the instructions, Turing did himself, acting as a human CPU requiring more than half an hour per move. One game is recorded, which Turing's "paper machine" lost to one of his colleagues, Alick Glennie. At the University of Manchester, Turing began programming Turochamp, as well as Michie's and Wylie's program Machiavelli, to run on a Ferranti Mark 1 computer, but could not complete them." 

History of Computer Chess according to Wiki:

1769 – Wolfgang von Kempelen builds the Automaton Chess-Player, in what becomes one of the greatest hoaxes of its period.

1868 – Charles Hooper presented the Ajeeb automaton — which also had a human chess player hidden inside.

1912 – Leonardo Torres y Quevedo builds a machine that could play King and Rook versus King endgames.

1941 – Konrad Zuse develops computer chess algorithms in his Plankalkül programming formalism. However, because of the circumstances of the war, they were not published, and weren't known until the 1970s.

1948 – Norbert Wiener's book Cybernetics describes how a chess program could be developed using a depth-limited minimax search with an evaluation function.

1950 – Claude Shannon publishes "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", one of the first papers on the problem of computer chess.

1951 – Turing & Champernowne are first to publish a program, developed on paper, that was capable of playing a full game of chess.

## NOLAN BUSHNELL
American. B: 1943 – Current.  Founded more than 20 companies, and is considered one of the founding fathers of video games. He is most popularly known for creating the game system Atari. inducted into the Video Game Hall of Fame and the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame, received the BAFTA Fellowship and the Nations Restaurant News “Innovator of the Year” award, and was named one of Newsweek's "50 Men Who Changed America."  Is credited with Bushnels law of gmaes being "easy to learn, difficult to master" being rewarding. Joined Perrone Robotics, that makes robotic software platforms for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots.

## DON RAWITSCH, BILL HEINEMANN, and PAUL DILLENBERGER
American. Created the game Oregon Trail. Rawitsch wanted to create the game to make learning about western expansion more interesting for the 8th grade class he was teaching. The game is said to almost have too much information in it, which is conter-produtctive to its objective of teaching. 

## TOMOHIRO NISHIKADO
Japanese. B: 1944 - Current.  Japanese video game developer, that created Elepong (similar to Pong), one of Japan's earliest locally produced video arcade games. Created the popular game space invaders, using the objects he did due to insufficient computing power to program gram objects like planes. 

## JERRY LAWSON
American. B: 1940 - 2011. Was an engineering consult for several companies, until he finally became director of engineering and marketing for Fairchild's video game division. There, he led the development of the Fairchild Channel F console, and the removal ROM cartridges for game consols. This was big, since most games were directly programed into a consol, and couldnt be removed. Was the sole black members of the Homebrew Computer Club, which also included popular people like Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
