She used these notes to say that the machine would be able to calculate an archane sequence of figures called Bernouli Numbers.
By diagraming the computations that the machine could make, she basically wrote the first computer algorithms.
## Charles Babbage
Cosidered as the Father of the Computer, Babbage created the first computer in 1837.  
He created a machine known as the Anylytical Engine, that had a CPU, and memory by using the punch cards used to run mills.
Babbage worked close with Ada Lovelace, who created the first computer program.  Lovelace saw that the anylytical engine could be used for more than just computing mathmatics.
Babbage created the Anylitical Engine to increase work productivity for making calculations
