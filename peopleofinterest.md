# People of Interest
## Ada Lovelace
Ada Lovelace was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.  During her upbringing her mother encouraged her to learn about art and science,encouraging her to persue a career in science.
She met a scientist by the name of Charles Babbage, who is considered the father of the computer.  Babbage created an anylytical machine, and had Lovelace review the notes over the device.
She used these notes to say that the machine would be able to calculate an archane sequence of figures called Bernouli Numbers.
By diagraming the computations that the machine could make, she basically wrote the first computer algorithms.
## Charles Babbage
Cosidered as the Father of the Computer, Babbage created the first computer in 1837.  
He created a machine known as the Anylytical Engine, that had a CPU, and memory by using the punch cards used to run mills.
Babbage worked close with Ada Lovelace, who created the first computer program.  Lovelace saw that the anylytical engine could be used for more than just computing mathmatics.
Babbage created the Anylitical Engine to increase work productivity for making calculations
## Joseph Marie Charles (aka Jacquard)
Joseph was born as a merchant/weaver in France, into a well-to-do family that was well off with money.  But despite this, Joseph remained illeterate until he was 13 years old.  When his father died, he was left with a house, vineyard, looms, a workshop, and a quarry to manage.  Joseph went on to invent several contraptions related to the textile/weaving industry.  But the most important of his inventions because known as the Jacquard Loom.
The Jacquard Loom is a mechanical loom that has cards placed in sequences togather.  The cards had holes punched into them, that told the loom the sequence to weave the threads on the loom.  This allowed the loom to weave complex designs and color patterns, that could be easily changed by switching the cards around.
Although the loom changed the world of textiles, it was alos a milestone for computers.  The punched cards were a big step in computing using a machine.  Later, Charles Babbage was inspired by Joseph to use similar punchcards in his Anylytical engine.  The punch cards were also used to count for the US census'.
The Jacquard loom was considered the first step in mordern computers.
